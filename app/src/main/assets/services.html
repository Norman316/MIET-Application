                    Monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) is an important part of programme conceptualization so that, from the onset, the goal, objectives, targets and indicators of success are articulated and guide implementation. When any new programme is conceptualized with project teams, MER is built into the logical framework.<br/>Data is continuously collected, analysed and fed back to the project team for formative purposes. This entails monitoring the effectiveness of implementation, the extent to which the project implementation adheres to timeframes and an assessment of the cost-efficiency of implementation.<br/>We also recognize the importance of knowledge management and offer knowledge management services, such as documenting processes, so that using and sharing knowledge is maximized.
